# contactmysqlupgrade
This adds a longer contact form for existing project created on this site.
https://github.com/wdraghwendra/phpmysql/tree/master/contact

Depending on your needs and how patient your customers are the longer form may not be beneficial. This code works assuming a proper MYSQL login in the contact12.php.(We went through 12 revisions from base).
